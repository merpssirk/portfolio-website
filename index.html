            The website takes a long time to build. There are a lot of things that have to happen before it can go live. Good things take time to create and any good designer or developer is going to take their time so they deliver you something that both them and you can be proud of.</p>

            <p>I enjoy taking complex problems and turning them into simple and beautiful interface designs. I also love the logic and structure of coding and always strive to write elegant and efficient code. Whether it be HTML, CSS or JS.</p>

                    <p><b>Why Intrested in Web Design?</b></p>
                    <P>Five Advantages to a Web Design Career</P>
                    <p>Feed your creative side. From graphics to color schemes, website design jobs let you use artistic skills in your day-to-day work. If you have an excellent aesthetic sense and are detail-oriented in your design approach, then Web design might be a good match. Plus, designers who work for agencies rarely get bored, because most projects require something new.</p>
                    <p>Work on the Web. Who doesn't love the Internet? Being a Web designer enables you to not only work with websites every day but also to shape the way people interact with the Web. Plus, these days, a customer's first impression of a company is often through its website rather than print materials such as business cards or marketing mailings. Working with the Web as your medium allows you to make a big impact on a company's brand. The Web is always exciting because the industry changes frequently—best practices emerge and are fine-tuned, trends take hold and technology updates.</p>
                    <p>Use sophisticated technology. If you enjoy using computers and design software, then Web design jobs will provide the opportunity to do so. And you won't get bored working only with design software, because Web designers typically need to know HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
                    <p>Be independent. Although many designers work in-house for large organizations or are part of a design firm's staff, there are also many opportunities to work for yourself. Being self-employed allows you to pick what clients you want to work with, set your rates and work hours, specialize in websites for a certain business industry and hone your business and marketing skills.</p>
                    <P>Work in a growing industry. Every company needs a website and wants to keep it looking current, which puts web designers and developers in high demand. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in its current Occupational Outlook Handbook states that employment for web developers, included in the larger category of web designers, is projected to grow 13 percent through 2026, which is much faster than average for all occupations.</P>

                            <h1>Product Strategy</h1>
                            <p><b>Why Product Strategy is Important?</b></p>
                                <p>
                                All great products start with a clear strategy that is customer and market-driven. Your strategy defines the direction of your product and what you want to achieve. Establishing this first aligns the organization and keeps everyone focused on the work that matters the most. It tells the team where the product is headed and what needs to be done to get there.</p>
                                
                                <p>Strategy definition is an important part of product planning. It aligns executives and other key stakeholders around your desired end state and how the product will achieve your business objectives. It also guides the implementation and to communicate the value of the product to cross-functional teams, such as sales, marketing, and support.</p>
                                
                                <p>A product strategy is the foundation for the entire product lifecycle. As product leaders develop and adjust their product strategy, they zero in on target customers and what they need. This informs the strategic positioning necessary to achieve business success. Once your strategy definition is completed, you can use it to shape your product definition. This is when you describe the solution your product will provide and plan what you will build and when. Product definition includes details about key product requirements — such as releases, features, user flow and design, and technical specifications.</p>
                                
                                <p>Strategy definition includes three major components: vision, goals, and initiatives.</p>
                                <p>Vision</p>
                                <p>Your vision includes details on the market opportunity, target customers, positioning, a competitive analysis, and the Go-to-Market plan. It describes who the customers are, what they need, and how you plan to deliver a unique offering.</p>
                                <p>Goals</p>
                                <p>Goals are measurable, time-bound objectives that have clearly defined success metrics associated with them. They help you set what you want to achieve in the next quarter, year, or 18 months. Here are a few examples:</p>

                                <p>Increase revenue by 30%
                                Expand into 5 new countries
                                Increase mobile adoption by 100%
                                Enter 3 new market segments
                                Reduce the number of support tickets by 15%

                        <p>
                        What is a Blog?</p>
                        <p>A blog is a type of website where the content is presented in reverse chronological order (newer content appear first). Blog content is often referred to as entries or “blog posts”.</p>

                        <p>Blogs are typically run by an individual or a small group of people to present information in a conversational style. However, now there are tons of corporate blogs that produce a lot of informational and thought-leadership style content.</p>
                        <p>History of Blogs</p>
                        <p>Blogs evolved from online diaries and journals in the mid-90s. At that time, internet users were already running personal web pages where they published regular updates about their personal lives, thoughts, and social commentary.

                        The term web log was first used during the late 90s, which later became ‘weblog’, then ‘we blog’, and finally just ‘blog’.

                        Due to the growing number of such web pages, several tools started to appear, which made it easier for users to create online journals and blogs. These tools helped popularize blogging and made the technology accessible to non-technical users.

                        In 1999, the popular blogging website Blogger.com was launched, which was later acquired by Google in February 2003.

                        The same year, WordPress released its first version as a blogging platform in May 2003.

                        Today, WordPress is the world’s most popular blogging platform powering over 30% of all websites on the internet.</p>

                                <p>
                                    website layout is a pattern (or framework) that defines a website's structure. It has the role of structuring the information present on a site both for the website's owner and for users. It provides clear paths for navigation within webpages and puts the most important elements of a website front and center.
                                </p>
                                <p>What is a good website?
 
                                A good website is functional. By its layout, design and content, that website fulfils its role. Therefore, it accomplishes the following functions:

                                Not only is a good website functional, but it’s also effective. *Read “effective” as more than simply “functional” – that site drives to performance. Effectiveness relates to:

                                Traffic – the first condition for a brand to sell is getting enough traffic.
                                Engagement – for users to perform whatever action you expect them to perform, they need high levels of engagement. This translates into micro-interactions,                                 interactivity, gamification, etc.
                                Leads – if you have traffic, you increase chances to have leads. Leads are potential clients, more inclined to buy your products/services.
                                Conversions – this is the actual point of sale. The number of conversions directly influences the company ROI.
                                Trust – this is a non-measurable value that has a lot to do with how people feel about your brand, your company, your offering.
                                Brand that’s easy to remember – this is also a difficult to measure value that does a lot in terms of promotion.
                                Authority – a website’s authority relies on links (votes) pointing to the website. For search engines, these links are an indicator that your website is a reliable source users can count on. As a result, the website will be more visible in search engine results pages and viewed by a larger number of users.
                                SEO – search engine optimization directly impacts a website’s visibility, with consequences for traffic, engagement and sales.
                                Beware how you meet the above objectives, they’ll influence your website effectiveness a lot. According to Sewor, 38% of people stop engaging with a website if the content or layout are unattractive.

 

                                The definition of what makes a good website can be split into specific definitions of the most important elements that ensure site success.</p>

                                <p>
                                    Sketch is great for website design. I've been using it for the past couple of years for website and mobile design, as well as for wireframing, basically for UI and UX. And just so you know, prior to using Sketch, I've been using Photoshop for 8 years, basically since I started doing design. </p>
                                    <p>Sketch is not only good for web design, but it’s also good for actually making live websites.</p>
                                     <p>I would have used it way earlier (Sketch), but I was skeptical and I was wrong. Once I started using Sketch I was blown away of how good it was and how fast things were going just because you have some cool options at your hand. And that was important since I was and still am working on complex web and mobile platforms where you have to build a really lot of things. So I just went ahead and made Sketch my primary tool. I still use Photoshop but mainly for image editing cause personally I feel that I can work with images better in Photoshop. But when it comes to interfaces, Sketch is my “go to” tool.</p>
